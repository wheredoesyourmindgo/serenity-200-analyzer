        "With a silent order, I urged Snout forward but he veered away, charging toward Hazel instead. No, Snout! I thought. Toward the roof! He ignored me. That was the problem with a machine that obeyed your thoughts. Instead of doing what you said, it did what you wanted.",
        "This next test may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: If you meet yourself on the testing track, don't make eye contact. Lab boys tell me that'll wipe out time. Entirely. Forward and backward! So do both of yourselves a favor and just let that handsome devil go about his business.",
        "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.",
        "Your biggest concern while in this realm will likely be the Nyctofly. This airborne insect lives in heavily wooded areas and can locate you from far away. When you hear its wings fluttering, you know that it's time to fight. It's much harder to fight in open areas, so it's advised to stay in a tight space.",

        "This subspecies of grub-dog has a thick coat of soft white fur that obscures its abdominal markings. The fur also warms its vital organs, making this species well adapted to colder climates. However, its hair follicles are surprisingly frail, which can result in immediate hair loss if the creature is surprised.",
        "This beastly predator's aggressive ejection of high-speed projectiles makes it one of the most fearsome creatures in the ecosystem. Its body seems to comprise of both biological and mechanical components, and represents one of the most evolutionarily advanced specimens ever observed. The chamber within its torso gives it rapid-fire bio-pellet launch capabilities. What appears to be a tail fin is in fact the base of its counter-weight and ammunition cylinder, so immobilizing this appendage will prevent the groink from attacking... at least in theory. Confirmation of this suspicion remains elusive, as nobody has volunteered to test it.",

        "Were you in love with him? I guess I'll never really know. I just know I felt things I'd never felt before, a kind of wrenching feeling. I didn't know what it was, it just tore at my heart. Have you ever felt that way?",
        "The reason your attention isn't great is because you haven't trained it. You keep switching through the channels of your mind and never stop long enough to really focus on one.",

        "It is those who are successful, in other words, who are most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success. It's the rich who get the biggest tax breaks. It's the best students who get the best teaching and most attention. And it's the biggest nine and ten-year-olds who get the most coaching and practice. Success is the result of what sociologists like to call \"accumulative advantage\".",

        "We have learned to fear our planet and fled to the stars in search of a new one. But the fascination for other worlds could not turn my eyes away from the beauty of our home.

Gotta make you understand. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.",
        "It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.",
        "Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together! Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!",
        "When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom... permanently. From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything!",
        "I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. Bumi, you're a mad genius.",
        "I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.",
        "You know what they say: \"For every good battle, you need a good adversary.\" And I felt that Gnasty, in spite of his misguided nature, was a worthy opponent.",
        "But you saw the Professor's book! They have claws like this, and teeth like this, and they spit fire like this! They sound much more dangerous than Ripto!",
        "My tactical instincts told me the Sorceress would attack you here, so I flew in to help out. It seems my rocket launchers don't affect this creature, but I can assist you by dropping ammunition. Now get in there and fight the good fight!",
        "Oh, you have to trust me, Regina. I know best. Love is weakness, Regina. It feels real now. At the start, it always does. But, it's an illusion. It fades. And then, you're left with nothing. But power, true power, endures. And then, you don't have to rely on anyone to get what you want. I've saved you, my love.",
        "You're so afraid of losing the people that you love that you push them away. And that's why you'll always be an orphan. You don't need some villain swooping in to destroy your happiness. You do that quite well all on your own.",
        "True love isn't easy, but it must be fought for. Because once you find it, it can never be replaced.",
        "I wanna taste something other than sweetness. I wanna cry salty tears, learn bitter truths. I wanna take a big, meaty bite out of life and dip it in mustard.",
        "Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog.",
        "Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.",
        "Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will.",
        "You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing... Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay!",
        "What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all.",
        "If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.",

        "You're something out of a dream! Messing with my head. And I've been looking for you. Are you hiding? 'Cause I like the way you're calling to me! Your spell upon me. You're something out of a dream! And I like it, though I fight it.",
        "It's just a test, test 1, 2, 3, baby I'm missin' you. Tell me are you missin' me? 'Cause it hasn't been a long time; girl, I already wish you were by my side.",
        "You step outside, you risk your life. You take a drink of water, you risk your life. And nowadays you breathe, and you risk your life. Every moment now... you don't have a choice. The only thing you can choose is what you're risking it for.",
        "When I grow up, I want to be just like you, and I think I'm on the right track. Get it? Track, because horses run on tracks, and you are a horse, and I am a horse. Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?",
        "I know. I mean, I know, but I don't always know, you know? Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, \"Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!\"",
        "Over these last two nights, you've drawn an outline of a person. A person who doesn't think about others, a person who puts his own needs first. And over and over, other people get hurt, not necessarily because he means to hurt them, but because he just doesn't care. This person I'm describing, is it a different person, or is it you?",
        "These are cookies. This is not breakfast. You are eating cookies. Stop it! Stop eating cookies and go make yourself breakfast! Stop it! Don't eat one more cookie! Put that cookie down! Do not eat that cookie! I can't believe you ate that cookie!",

        "I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now... Come further up, come further in!",
        "When the police arrived and found no lion, no broken wall, and no convicts, and the Head behaving like a lunatic, there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things about Experiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head's friends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector to interfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn't much good even at that, they got her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.",
        "We tend to think that we are happier if we take things into our own hands. The opposite is true: Simona Botti from Cornell University has shown in experiments that when we make our own decisions we suffer nagging doubt that we didn't make the best choice. However, if another person decides for us, or if we toss a coin, we are either grateful or - if the outcome is bad - can blame someone else.",
        "On a clear day you can see for twenty-five miles in all directions because you are in the largest observation wheel ever built. You are sealed into one of the thirty-two capsules with the strangers who were next to you in the queue, and when they close the doors, the sound of the city is cut off. You begin to rise. The capsules are made of glass and steel and are hung from the rim of the wheel. As the wheel turns, the capsules use the force of gravity to stay upright. It takes thirty minutes to go a full circle.",
        "While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken, at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.",
        "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",
        "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own, and you know what you know. And you are the guy who'll decide where to go.",
        "Life is a series of decisions. Whether you make the correct decisions or not doesn't matter. The important thing is to keep going forward. Years later, when you look back, perhaps you'll find that the incorrect decisions you made... weren't really incorrect. Similarly, the correct decisions... might not necessarily have been correct. Why struggle with frustration? Why proceed with confusion? In all things... resolution only comes from continuing to move forward. Following this line of reasoning, if there is no such thing as \"incorrect,\" then how can the \"correct\" exist? Similarly, if there is no \"correct,\" then how can the \"incorrect\" exist?",
        "Castelli Romani is a general term for the white wines of the volcanic hills to the south-east of Rome in the region of Lazio which stretch from just outside the city gates (some of the vineyards are in fact within the administrative borders of the city) into the province of Latina, south of the township of Velletri. Over 6,700 hectares/16,750 acres of denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) vineyards fall within the zone and are divided into seven different appellations: Castelli Romani (1,400 hectares of vineyard in the late 1990s); Colli Albani (1,115 hectares), Colli Lanuvini (950 hectares), Frascati (some 2,150 hectares) Marion (1,000 hectares), Montecompari (12 hectares), and Velletri (137 hectares).",
        "In the Cote Chalonnaise and the Maconnais to the south, plantings overtook those of Gamay in the 1980s so that there were 4,500 hectares by 1988 and 6,200 hectares by 2000. From the Cote Chalonnaise, the whites of Rully, Mercurey, and Montagny can offer economical, if slightly rustic, versions of the grander names of the Cote d'Or.",
        "China's wine boom has prompted considerable developments in viticulture. Thousands of native grape varieties exist in northern China, many from wild species as breeding is a preoccupation of Chinese research institutions.",
        "Most winemakers, therefore, and certainly all concerned with high-volume production, choose to speed the process up by intervening with one or more of filtration, centrifugation, flotation, and the much cheaper process of fining, the addition of agents which aid agglomeration and settling of colloids in the must or new wine.",
        "What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for.",
        "I've been quite open about this around the office: I don't want this park's department to build any parks, because I don't believe in government. I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.",
        "Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Don't teach a man to fish... and feed yourself. He's a grown man. Fishing's not that hard.",
        "I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me. Plus, the whole thing is a scam. Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.",
        "There's only one thing I hate more than lying: skim milk. Which is water that's lying about being milk.",
        "I call this turf 'n' turf. It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse. Also, whiskey and a cigar. I am going to consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.",
        "Welcome to 'Visions of Nature'. This room has several paintings in it. Some are big, some are small. People did them and they're here now. I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings. Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me. I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they could just go outside and stand in it. Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further. End of speech.",
        "Normally, if given the choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I'd work all night, if it meant nothing got done.",
        "It's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.",
        "You choose a thankless job. You can't be upset when nobody thanks you. Don't start chasing applause and acclaim. That way lies madness.",

        "There's a feeling I get when I look to the west. And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, and the voices of those who stand looking.",
        "And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all, to be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",
        "If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.",
        "Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.",

        "It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.",
        "For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.",
        "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small disregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.",
        "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity - distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.",
        "There's much more. There's all that goes beyond - all that is elsewhere - and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those, when I was selected. And here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.",
        "Atticus said to Jem one day, \"I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \"Your father's right,\" she said. \"Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\"",
        "Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliche. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools? Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.",
        "And my friend said, \"I know you love her, but it's over, mate. It doesn't matter, put the phone away. It's never easy to walk away, let her go. It'll be okay. It's gonna hurt for a bit of time. So bottoms up, let's forget tonight. You'll find another and you'll be just fine, let her go. It'll be alright\".",
        "Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing.",
        "For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.",

        "Even in the darkest and most cruel person, there is still a kernel of good. And within the most perfect champion, there is darkness. The question is, will one give in to the dark or the light? It's something we decide with every choice we make, every day that we exist. What might not be evil to you could be evil to someone else. Knowing this makes us powerful even without magic.",
        "Just remember who you are... The world will try to change you into someone else. Don't let them. That's the best advice anyone can give you.",
        "The best leaders make mistakes and then learn from them. The best leaders never make the same mistakes again. The only way you can learn is if you understand the mistakes that were made.",
        "It'd be like looking for a needle in a burning haystack. Oh, I've done that, Mark said airily. It's a game we used to play, after we got rid of all our livestock and didn't need our hay no more. You throw a match into the haystack, give the fire a three-second head start, and begin looking. You can find the needle every time if you work quick.",
        "True beauty is what lies inside of us, not what the world sees. A beautiful shell that houses a vile soul becomes sullied over time. But an outer shell, imperfect as it may be, that houses a beautiful soul shines with that beauty, radiating it for all who have eyes to see.",
        "This neighborhood is a lifeboat in a storm we can't stop. Only so many people can be in our boat, no matter how many swimmers you see bobbing about in the ocean. If you try to pull in too many, you sink. You save nobody, including those who were in the boat. Our priority has to be those who are in the boat, because we can't save all of those who need to be in the boat. Our only exception has been when those on the outside can make our lifeboat stronger and more self-sustaining.",
        "Everyone is guilty of something, and everyone still harbors a memory of childhood innocence, no matter how many layers of life wrap around it. Humanity is innocent; humanity is guilty, and both states are undeniably true.",
        "People, I have discovered, are layers and layers of secrets. You believe you know them, that you understand them, but their motives are always hidden from you, buried in their own hearts. You will never know them, but sometimes you decide to trust them.",
        "After graduating from our school, they went into the Woods expecting epic battles with monsters and wizards, only to find their fairy tales unfold right in their own houses. They didn't realize that villains are the ones closest to us. They didn't realize that to find a happy ending, a hero must first look right under his nose.",
        "It's a queer thing, growing up. The years pile up, Hap, but at the same time I'm still ever age I ever was. When we stood before those sea-giants, I felt five years old, awed and scared. When I see a pretty lady, I'm eighteen again! And when my bones remind me, I feel all of my sixty years. All those ages are still inside me, all at once. The years stack up like sediment, and the layers remain.",
        "You're used to being underestimated, so you want to prove yourself. Don't let that be your crutch. Accept help when you need it.",
        "Making mistakes is part of learning to choose well. No way around it. Choices are thrust upon us, and we don't always get things right. Even postponing or avoiding a decision can become a choice that carries heavy consequences. Mistakes can be painful-sometimes they cause irrevocable harm-but welcome to Earth. Poor choices are part of growing up, and part of life. You will make bad choices, and you will be affected by the poor choices of others. We must rise above such things.",
        "Knowledge always has the potential to be dangerous. It is a more powerful weapon than any sword or spell.",

        "The world isn't fair? What a huge revelation! Some people in power abuse those they have power over? Amazing! When did this start happening?",
        "Why do clothes never have enough pockets? There should always be lots of pockets... the more pockets, the better!",
        "I walked up to Griz and poked him in the chest. \"Let me make this perfectly clear to you. Though some might seek to make it appear otherwise, I am not a bride to be bartered away to another kingdom, not a prize of war, not a mouthpiece for your Komizar. I am not a chip in a card game to be mindlessly tossed into the center of the pot, nor one to be kept in the tight fist of a greedy opponent. I am a player seated at the table alongside everyone else, and from this day forward, I will play my own hand as I see fit. Do you understand me? Because the consequences could be ugly if someone thought otherwise.\"",

        "I've spent a lifetime practicing, becoming who I must be to survive. Hiding in plain sight, always acting, always playing a part. There are times when I fear that I'll lose me, my true self, in the haze of the facade. But that fear doesn't matter to anyone besides myself.",
        "A week ago you said to me, \"Do you believe I'll never be too far.\" If you're lost, just look for me, you'll find me in the region of the summer stars. The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye means we've already won. A necessity for apologies between you and me, baby, there is none.",
        "Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did. Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid. I'm still standing after all this time. Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.",
        "All my life, you stood by me, when no one else was ever behind me. All these lights, they can't blind me. With your love, nobody can drag me down.",
        "At some point in your childhood you and your friends went outside to play together for the last time and nobody knew.",
        "What is the cause of historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person. On what condition are the wills of the masses transferred to one person? On condition that the person express the will of the whole people. That is, power is power. That is, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand.",
        "At moments of departure and a change of life, people capable of reflecting on their actions usually get into a serious state of mind. At these moments they usually take stock of the past and make plans for the future.",
        "I don't pretend to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and, though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.",
        "You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.",
        "Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.",
        "There's a word like overprotective to describe some parents, but no word that means the opposite. What word do you use to describe parents who don't protect enough? Underprotective? Neglectful? Self-involved? Lame? All of the above.",
        "Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can't remember how you got from where you were to where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story.",
        "Life is like a tray of fruits. Some fruits are sour, others are sweet. Some fruits are ripe, and other fruits are rotten. Never expect the best out of what you get.",
        "It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog. It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log. But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do, will make me feel alright.",
        "Fear was always a part of life for the people. Because of fear, they made shelter and found food and grew things. For the same reason, weapons were stored, waiting. There was fear of cold, of sickness and hunger. There was fear of beasts.",
        "He saw Forest and understood what Seer had meant. It was an illusion. It was a tangled knot of fears and deceits and dark struggles for power that had disguised itself and almost destroyed everything. Now it was unfolding, like a flower coming into bloom, radiant with possibility.",
        "It bothered him a little to lie about small things. But he always had; he had grown up lying, and he still found it strange that the people in this place where he now lived thought lying was wrong. To Matty, it was sometimes a way of making things easier, more comfortable, more convenient.",
        "I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.",
        "Perhaps simple to be known, to be looked upon by so many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps this was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into something else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy one became one day a man.",
        "And I defend because in spite of all I find that I love. In order to get some of it down I have to love. I sell you no phony forgiveness, I'm a desperate man - but too much of your life will be lost, its meaning lost, unless you approach it as much through love as through hate. So I approach it through division so I denounce and I defend and I hate and I love.",
        "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",
        "I wish that strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals, and gall, which makes a man grow angry for all his great mind, that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man's heart and becomes a thing sweeter to him by far than the dripping of honey.",
        "If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much; if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and - which is more - you'll be a man, my son!",
        "Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.",
        "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...",
        "We caught fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.",
        "Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the south, and I've lived in the north; so I know the average all around. The average man's a coward.",
        "Would you really dig into yesterday's garbage to make tonight's meal? Do you dig into old mental garbage to create tomorrow's experiences? If a thought or belief does not serve you, let it go! There is no written law that says that because you once believed something, you have to continue to believe it forever.",
        "It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names.",
        "Well, then, here we are. A little challenge for you all as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys, whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking. Something to separate the men from the boys, the wheat from the chaff, the mesons from the pi mesons, the quarks from the quacks. Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it.",
        "I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers. My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley's Double-Mint.",

        "I breathed in my new surroundings. The air smelled different here, I don't know whether it was the desert air or the dry trees or just that I was far away from the stink of the city, but I liked it.",
        "Are you even listening? Look at me! These kids believe in you, but this isn't about you helping them anymore. This is about you loving all of the attention, and the hero worship. If you care about these kids, I mean truly care about them, you'll turn yourself in before anyone gets hurt. That's what a real leader would have the courage to do.",
        "There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.",

        "Behold the dreaded toboggan: the suicide sled. Its unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note, too, the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes, this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb.",
        "Everybody seeks happiness! Not me, though! That's the difference between me and the rest of the world. Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!",
        "As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. You've taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.",

        "Well, what do you say? Would you like to be transmogrified? Don't be scared, the process is instantaneous and completely painless. Just think! With the push of a button, you could be a 500-story gastropod - a slug the size of the Chrysler building!",
        "People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them. But really, art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world.

        "Is \"defeat\" proof that you are weak? Isn't \"defeat\" more like a trial to overcome? Of whether you can stand up and walk again after falling to your knees? If you remain on your knees like that, then it would be a sign of weakness.",

        "Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, or next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think that it will never come, it probably never will.",
        "Even if we're not confident that we'll win, even if others tell us we don't stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that.",

        "It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.",

        "Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players - and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement.",
        "What makes something special is not just what you have to gain, but what you feel there is to lose.",
        "Freed from the thoughts of winning, I instantly play better. I stop thinking, start feeling. My shots become a half-second quicker, my decisions become the product of instinct rather than logic.",
        "You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.",

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.",
        "I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, if someone deserves a tip, if they really put forth an effort, I'll give them a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.",
        "What's it going to be then, eh? There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip chill winter bastard though dry.",

        "If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you're more likely to give up and throw it away. Including the relationships you have in your hand now. Because it's precious, because you don't want to lose it, you hide it away and put up a front. That's why everyone lies. But... the biggest liar of all... was me.",
        "For twelve years you've been asking \"Who is John Galt?\" This is John Galt speaking. I'm the man who's taken away your victims and thus destroyed your world. You've heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis and that Man's sins are destroying the world. But your chief virtue has been sacrifice, and you've demanded more sacrifices at every disaster.

Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.",
        "In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.",

        "Don't compare yourself with anyone in this world... If you do so, you are insulting yourself.",
        "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.",
        "You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say. I'm talking loud, not saying much. I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet. Shoot me down, but I get up. I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose. Fire away, fire away. Ricochet, you take your aim. Fire away, fire away.",
        "Mankind is the animal that makes tools. In each generation, only a few people get a chance to create new tools. Very, very few get to contribute to making a tool that changes the lives of first hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands, and someday millions of people.",

        "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.",
        "The world was a terrible place, cruel, pitiless, dark as a bad dream. Not a good place to live. Only in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness - and love.

        "The man that I named the Giver passed along to the boy knowledge, history, memories, color, pain, laughter, love, and truth. Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing. It is very risky. But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere. It gives him choices. It gives him freedom. Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.",
        "We were talking about the space between us all and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion, never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away.",

        "Tell them only that the Lich King is dead and that Bolvar Fordragon, died with him! Now go - leave this place and never return!",
        "The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place amongst the legends of the past.",

        "And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars when our time would come.",

        "I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor.",
        "Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving.",
        "When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.",

        "He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.",
        "He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.",
        "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.",
        "He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.",
        "It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.",
        "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",
        "Okay, may I speak now? Because I happen to be an expert on punishment, and I'm not sure it fits the crime here. I mean, Carver made a mistake - well, several really - but... you're different. He's changed. Doesn't that mean anything to you?",
        "And you... how are you any better? Why do humans think they can rectify one evil with another? I mean, it's clearly the first time this reptile has truly loved a woman and this is his reward?",
        "It's not about being right or wrong. There are more important things than that. That's why apologies and forgiveness become necessary.",
        "I would rather look up to my superiors than have them look down on me. Ashamed either way; I will learn in the end.",

        "He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.",
        "Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger.",

        "She could not sleep, although she had tried hard, and most of the night she spent pacing up and down from window to door turning over the amazing situation in which she found herself.",
        "We found a blanket, and pillows, down there, and, as you say, it has obviously been a wine cellar, because there is a ventilating shaft leading up into the bushes.",

        "Thrice he smote that strong, ironbound box, and at the third blow it burst open and a great heap of gold came rolling forth, gleaming red in the light of the torches.",
        "I shall take it with me, for it will be better used for charity and the good of my merry band than in the enriching of such knaves as these.",
        "Rich food was brought them and noble wines, and she had her own pages to wait upon the wants of the yeomen.",
        "In front of the door three merry fellows, a tinker, a peddler, and a beggar, were seated on a bench in the sun quaffing stout ale.",
        "Fifteen there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself, thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that stood nigh.",

        "His suavity and blandness forgotten in the presence of death, he mounted with confident alacrity to heights of greatness.",
        "When a gentleman grew pressing in his attentions, she more than suspected his motives; and when she eventually declined him it was done with perfect, courtesy, but the glow of her eyes was at such times accentuated to a marked degree.",
        "The room was dark now save in the small radius of its amber glow; beyond that was darkness where panels and brasses blinked.",
        "Learning is rampant in the land, and valuable information is pasted up in the streetcars so that he who rides may read.",
        "He was frankly grateful to her for refusing him; and, the mask of affectation slipped, she saw in him another man.",
        "He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.",

        "Two ships that at the distance seemed of considerable burden were heading towards them some five miles away.",
        "Frankness looked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide; commiseration repressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh young mouth.",
        "I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.",
        "At her present rate of progress it would be an hour, perhaps, before she came to anchorage within the harbour.",

        "They had done their best, and now he was sure they would doubtless remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to defend him.",
        "What it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears, yet to the highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be borne to the savage brain.",
        "At dawn he stopped to feed, and then he slept for several hours, taking up the pursuit again toward noon.",
        "It was evident that they had been dispatched to follow and bring back this party, and that the signal from the bank was one that had been determined upon before they left the village.",

        "When there is a hole in the chest wall, pulling the diaphragm down does not make any difference to the pressure outside the lungs.",
        "But this coming forward of the sternum means a widening of the chest from back to front, and the falling back of the sternum means a corresponding narrowing.",

        "A story is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle that would cover the whole floor of a room with its tiny pieces. But it's not the sort of puzzle that comes with a box. There is no lid with a picture on it so that you can see what the puzzle will look like when it's finished. And you have only some of the pieces. All you can do is keep looking and listening, sniffing about in all sorts of places, until you find the next piece.",
        "She inserted a fresh sheet of paper and began. Under her fingers, the keys rattled and clicked.

I will battle every day, to claim my rightful place! Come with me, the time is right, there's no better team! Arm in arm, we'll win the fight, it's always been our dream! Pokemon!

        "There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.

Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony - Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?",
        "At school nobody ever taught us how to light a cigarette in a storm of rain, nor how a fire could be made with wet wood - nor that it is best to stick a bayonet in the belly because it doesn't get jammed, as it does in the ribs.",

        "The last big rains of the year were falling. It was the time for treading red earth with which to build walls. It was not done earlier because the rains were too heavy and would have washed away the heap of trodden earth; and it could not be done later because harvesting would soon set in, and after that the dry season.",
        "She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.",
        "This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee 427. Employee 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.",
        "Well, it's no secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets, secretly.",
        "I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!",

        "My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.",
        "Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you will stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.",
        "Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.",
        "It seemed funny to me that the sunset she saw from her patio and the one I saw from the back steps was the same one. Maybe the two different worlds we lived in weren't so different. We saw the same sunset.",

        "As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.",
        "There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in physical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.",

        "There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.",
        "The term originated when such compound documents were created using manual paste up techniques for typographic page layout.",
        "These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory.",
        "To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols.",
        "This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.",
        "When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink.",
        "Typewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.",
        "Parton has said in interviews that when writing the song, to mimic the typing keys sound, she would run her acrylic fingernails back and forth against each other.",

        "Besides the character keys, a keyboard incorporates special keys that do nothing by themselves but modify the functions of other keys.",
        "A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks of keys, with home row being second from bottom.",
        "There are keyboards with two parallel sets of characters labeled on the keys, representing alternate alphabets or scripts.",
        "The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen, while text appears in the middle.",
        "In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the standard keyboard layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.",
        "Several engineers devised hardware and software to remap the keyboard, which were used inside the company and even sold commercially.",
        "The layouts are also used by people with full use of two hands, who prefer having one hand free while they type with the other.",

        "In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the buffer of sentences.",
        "This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.",
        "Although good accuracy may be achieved, any typing errors that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen.",
        "The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries.",
        "There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.",
        "Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.",
        "Again consider the integers and fractions together, omitting the points which correspond to the incommensurable ratios.",
        "Then a line drawn with the proper number of inches of length in the proper direction represents the required vector on the arbitrarily assigned scale of magnitude.",
        "We are evidently advancing towards the desired uniform definition which does not go out of the plane; but have not yet quite attained to uniformity.",
        "Everywhere order reigns, so that when some circumstances have been noted we can foresee that others will also be present.",
        "Our limited intellects cannot deal with complicated material all at once, and our method of arrangement is that of approximation.",
        "The result of this continual elimination of definite numbers by successive layers of parameters is that the amount of arithmetic performed by mathematicians is extremely small.",
        "Any limitation whatsoever upon the generality of theorems, or of proofs, or of interpretation is abhorrent to the mathematical instinct.",
        "Both parts of the problem are now known to be impossible; and the insoluble problem has now lost all special practical or theoretical interest, having become absorbed in wider ideas.",
        "There is, of course, the converse artistic method of preparing the imagination by the presentation of subordinate or special details, and then gradually rising to a crisis.",
        "Meanwhile the events of this physical universe succeed each other according to the mathematical laws which ignore all special sensations and thoughts and emotions.",
        "Newton gives first a special solution to the second problem in which he resorts to a rule for which he has given no proof.",
        "In comparing rectilinear figures, the method of superposition was employed by the ancients, but in comparing rectilinear and curvilinear figures with each other, this method failed because no addition or subtraction of rectilinear figures could ever produce curvilinear ones.",
        "Pappus proved also that the centre of gravity of a triangle is that of another triangle whose vertices lie upon the sides of the first and divide its three sides in the same ratio.",
        "All problems previously treated in a special and uncertain manner were referred back to a few general principles.",
        "He shows that the number of grains in a heap of sand not only as large as the whole earth, but as large as the entire universe, can be arithmetically expressed.",
        "His mode of working was, first to concentrate his powers upon a special problem, then to solve separately all problems growing out of the first.",
        "The greatest strength is found to lie, not in the suppression of either, but in the friendly rivalry between the two, and in the stimulating influence of the one upon the other.",
        "Being kept awake one night by a toothache, some thoughts undesignedly came into his head concerning the roulette or cycloid; one idea followed another; and he thus discovered properties of this curve even to demonstration.",
        "These are ordinary single algebra, ordinary double algebra, and quaternions, from which the imaginary scalar is excluded.",
        "There is indeed great doubt as to whether the quaternionic product can claim a necessary and fundamental place in a system of vector analysis.",
        "If through the advancing power of scientific methods, we find that the pursuits on which we were once engaged, afford no longer a sufficiently ample field for intellectual effort, the remedy is, to proceed to higher inquiries, and, in new tracks, to seek for difficulties yet unsubdued.",
        "Our present concern is rather with the laws of combination and of succession, by which its results are governed, and of these it will suffice to notice the following.",
        "Yet there are cases in which such inferences may lawfully be drawn, and in unrestricted argument they are of frequent occurrence.",
        "But if other considerations are admitted, each of these cases will be resolvable into others, individually less extensive, the number of which will depend upon the number of foreign considerations admitted.",
        "The lawful cases of the second class are those in which a particular conclusion only is deducible from two universal premises.",
        "It is peculiar to elective symbols, and will be found of great importance in enabling us to reduce our results to forms meet for interpretation.",
        "I shall in the following example employ this method, and shall only remark that those to whom it may appear doubtful, may verify its conclusions by the previous method.",
        "In discussing the second, and scarcely less momentous question of the influence of the use of symbols upon the discipline of the intellect, an important distinction ought to be made.",
        "Among the cases in which no inference was possible, it was found, that there were two distinct forms of the final equation.",
        "We shall prefer to contemplate the problem of the solution of elective equations under its most general aspect, which is the object of the succeeding investigations.",
        "This principle is indeed of fundamental importance; and it may with safety be affirmed, that the recent advances of pure analysis have been much assisted by the influence which it has exerted in directing the current of investigation.",
        "These are connected together by the copula is, or is not, or by some other modification of the substantive verb.",
        "An expression in which they are involved will be called an elective function, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, will be termed an elective equation.",
        "No inconsiderable part of the pleasure which we derive from the application of analysis to the interpretation of external nature, arises from the conceptions which it enables us to form of the universality of the dominion of law.",
        "Thus the law of what logicians term simple conversion, is determined by the fact, that the corresponding equations are symmetrical, that they are unaffected by a mutual change of place, in those symbols which correspond to the convertible classes.",
        "By assigning an appropriate meaning to our symbols, all the equations we have discussed would admit of interpretation in hypothetical, but it may suffice to have considered them as examples of categoricals.",
        "Every syllogism has three and only three terms, whereof that which is the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term, the predicate of the conclusion, the major term, and the remaining term common to both premises, the middle term.",
        "And it is further to be borne in mind, that although three different forms are given for the expression of each of the particular propositions, everything is really included in the first form.",
        "From the circumstance that the processes of algebra may be applied to the present system, it is not to be inferred that the interpretation of an elective equation will be unaffected by such processes.",

        "Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met.",
        "Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.",
        "It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.",

        "While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey.",
        "First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever.",

        "The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.",
        "It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.",
        "Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements.",
        "She left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right.",
        "He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation.",
        "We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.",
        "His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal.",
        "Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if it were just coming.",
        "A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge.",
        "But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble.",

        "Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.",
        "Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk.",
        "Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not.",
        "For years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinker's curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I've run... there's not a man or woman that I love left standing beside me.",
        "Ah... all Men desire to live by a Code, or a Creed, yes? Yet when pressed, most defer to their instincts rather than the Laws that bind them. But what is the appeal of a creed if it does not yoke all men to like behaviour?",

        "As he looks at the ancient tents, the humble equipment, the ring of small shockheads, a great tenderness comes over him.",
        "I will not dwell on his leisurely progress in the bright weather, or on his luncheon in a coppice of young firs, or on his thoughts which had returned to the idyllic.",

        "Asked about aerodynamics, Reichman emphasized his team's concern for stability, this is a rather fast vehicle after all. This encouraged serious testing to confirm its capabilities, including making use of computational fluid dynamics, a far cry from using tufts of yarn taped to an already-determined form.

        "If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.",

Von Autos \u00fcber TV bis hin zu Kinderspielzeug. Heute schon gibt es f\u00fcnfzehn Milliarden vernetzte Ger\u00e4te. 2020 wird es f\u00fcnfzig Milliarden geben. Da muss alles von vornherein sicher sein. So wie Microsoft das fr\u00fcher gemacht hat, geht es heute nicht mehr. Erst mal auf den Markt bringen und dann nachtr\u00e4glich das Feuer L\u00f6schen.\"",

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.",

Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way.",
        "Milkman is a dynamic character whose growth Morrison charts by illustrating his progressive awareness of the landscapes he moves within. Scenes that immerse Milkman in unfamiliar territory, that show him struggling as an uninitiated visitor to sylvan lands, are reminiscent of literature in the American naturalist tradition.",
        "That Sunday, cloud spilled down from the sky and swamped the streets with a hot mist that made the thermometers on the walls perspire.

        "I was confronted by a world that I could see and touch but didn't know how to talk about. There were so many words and names that I just didn't have. Flowers, trees, birds, reptiles, organs. The words you learn as you grow up in a country the ones the language reserves for people who are immersed in it and denies to those who just dip their toes in every now and then. The words for Saturday-afternoon strolls and summer camps and weekends in the country. Words from peaceful lives, lives that belong to the people living them.",

        "We should strive to welcome change and challenges, because they are what help us grow. Without them, we grow weak like the Eloi in comfort and security. We need to constantly be challenging ourselves in order to strengthen our character and increase our intelligence.",
        "It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have a huge variety of needs and dangers.",

        "I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.",

        "A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.",

        "So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.",
        "I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.",
        "I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.",
        "It's just that I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it too.",

And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.",
        "It's just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can't do anything except 'be there'. I just want to make him stop hurting, but I can't. So I just follow him around whenever he wants to show me his world.",
        "I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people. Maybe that is what makes people \"participate.\"",

Over the years I have spent among my beloved typing community so far, I have noticed that while there's plenty of sources for typing advice available for plenty of people who have sought it, they oftentimes only focus on a few certain aspects of typing as they tend to be pretty short and easy to read, and now and then the suggestions would contradict each other.",

        "Okay, here's the truth. You know that kid they're looking for? Sulley let her in! We tried to get her back but Waternoose had a secret plot and now Randall's right behind us, and he's trying to kill us!",
        "Look at everybody's favorite scarer now! You stupid, pathetic waste! You've been number one for too long, Sullivan! Now your time is up! And don't worry! I'll take good care of the kid!",
        "What are you doing? Take your hands off me! You can't arrest me! I hope you're happy, Sullivan! You've destroyed this company! Monsters Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now? The energy crisis will only get worse! Because of you!",
        "Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?",
        "Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean?",
        "Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, \"Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.\" Or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.",
        "No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to STAY SAVED, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?!",

        "This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?",

        "In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed a suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court.",

        "It's finally ready! You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all... I am your biggest fan.",
        "No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. Your daughter's suit was tricky. But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible... yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think?",
        "You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together! What will you do, is... is-is this a question?! You will show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you don't know where he is, go, confront the problem! Fight! WIN!",
        "I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance.",
        "Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. If the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood.",

        "Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat YOU! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super! And when everyone's super... no one will be.",

        "Last night I, I saw you standing and I started, started pretending that I knew you, and you knew me too. And just like a Roni, you were too shy. But you weren't the only 'cause so was I. And I dreamed of you ever since. Now I built up my confidence. Girl, next, next time you come my way, I'll know just what to say. Can we talk for a minute? Girl, I want to know your name.",
        "When I'm with you, I hear a sound that makes me laugh and smile and sing to you. When I'm with you, I feel so free. I love that love is going to take control of me. When I'm with you, it's for real. What I feel, when I'm with you. When I'm with you, I wonder why people do stop and stare and smile at us. When I'm with you, the sun shines my way. Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world.",
        "I'm gonna make a change for once in my life. Gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference, gonna make it right. As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat, this wind is blowing my mind. I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat. Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs. A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top, and a one man's soul. They follow each other on the wind, ya know. 'Cause they got nowhere to go, that's why I want you to know.",
        "I'm starting with the man in the mirror. I'm asking him to change his ways. And no message could have been any clearer. If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and then make a change.",
        "I've been watching you for so very long. Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong. I really want to meet you, but I'm kind of scared. 'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class. I get my thoughts together for the very next day. But, when I see you lady, I forget what to say. Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone. The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on.",
        "The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.",
        "I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese or anything.",
        "This is Stanky Dog, coming to you on the hottest day of the summer. Unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothing today. Yup, just find yourself a shady tree and maybe an aquatic mammal of some sort, and just blow the whole day off.",
        "A platypus? Perry the Platypus? You are mine now! No, that was the garage door opener. You are mine now! And that was the TV remote. You are mine now! Now I shall finally rid myself of you! But first, pay your attention to the giant screen and- Maybe I need to turn the cable on first?",
        "Oh, are you my new temp? Well, let me just get you up to speed. I know it's bit of a mess. I'm just putting the finishing touches of my latest maniacal plan. You see, in a few minutes, I will unleash an unprecedented reign of terror upon the entire... Tri-State Area! And Perry the Platypus will never be the wiser. Perry the Platypus?! You're a temp? Are times that hard?",
        "Follow-up single?! Who do you think we are, some two-bit hacks who will keep writing you songs simply because you pay us obscene amounts of cash? Phineas and the Ferb-Tones are strictly a one-hit wonder. Good day to you, sir. Diva tantrum, check. Elevator music, check.",
        "Hey Ferb, do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery, but I was thinking... let's open it up and see what this puppy can... Uh, Ferb, we're actually slowing down now. Ferb...? Hello?",
        "There's something very strange going on with Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been very quiet lately, a little too quiet! I want you to find out what's not going on and, uh... put a... stop... to it. I suppose.",
        "Okay, Candace, this is your beauty shot. The curse has been lifted, and you're no longer a monster. Now this scene is all about what the heart wants, but the mind can't have.",
        "Okay, boys. Let's have a fair and square fight and in no way should this ensuing fight contain the image of a potentially harmful, hurtful, or psychologically disturbing physical act that could be imitable by an impressionable child viewer.",
        "Ah, Perry the Platypus. Your timing is impeccable. And by \"impeccable,\" I mean completely peccable!",
        "Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made fifty-seven phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom or why. No, not to Santa!",
        "Okay, Ferb. If we're going to tackle this fashion design thing, we've got to do something really special. It has to be cool, comfortable... and undetectable by radar. Something that absolutely screams summer!",
        "Hi, I'm Candace. I'm sure you recognize me from my countless magazine covers. You know, being a supermodel is hard work: the bright lights, the deafening applause, and all those paper cuts from counting my huge stacks of money. That's why I start every morning with Candace-O's.",
        "Go ahead. Eat all you want. My dreams are smashed to pieces and all you can think about is food. But just remember, Gaston said that I will always be his cou de crayon.",
        "So, he was totally checkin' me out, when lil' Ms. Pants walks in front of me. Yeah, yeah. So, I was like, \"Um, hello\", and she was like, \"Oh no, you didn't\", then I was like, \"Oh, yes I did\".",
        "Ah, Perry the Platypus. As usual, your timing is uncanny. And by uncanny, I mean, \"completely\" canny!!",
        "Any last noises, Perry the Platypus? You know, that little chirping silly noise that you make? That's the one.",
        "As soon as he walks through that front door, no more Perry the Platypus. It's genius right? Oh! I told Nancy to keep the back door locked. Note to self. My evil deed for tomorrow: fire the maid.",
        "Perry the Platypus. Look, could you just use the front door from now on? Could you just do that for me?",
        "Perry the Platypus. As usual, your timing is incredible. And by incredible, of course, I mean completely credible!",
        "Beloved Bettys, your band is the biggest, baddest most bangin' buncha babes from Boston to Burbank. I've barely bathed since I began blogging about your bangin' beats. Your biggest Betty band fan, Candace.",
        "Then I can go on to eliminate all the other annoyances that make my skin crawl. Like, uh... Nature! Beauty! Morning talk show hosts! Soon, there will be nothing that can withstand the wrath of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz!",
        "Well, this can't be right. Lemme see those blueprints. Oh, wait a minute. Those are the plans for a Space Laser-inator, apparently. I was wondering what that thing was for. That must be the laser. Good thing we didn't attach it, huh?",
        "Ah, there you are, Agent P. We suspect your nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, has been pilfering bricks from buildings across the Tri-State Area. Animals are rioting, convicts are escaping from the zoo! It's chaos! You've got to stop him, Perry, before it all falls down.",
        "Perry the Platypus, how unexpected! And by \"unexpected\", I mean... unexpected. What are you doing here? This is my week off.",
        "Oh, hey, Agent P. So, get this, I got this memo this morning on Doofenshmirtz, and someone abbreviated his name in it. Guess how they wrote it? Doof! The Doof! It's times like these when you really appreciate having a cool name like Monogram.",
        "Perry the Platypus, I... You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape, then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little!",
        "Well, that sounds charming, boys, but I haven't played drums since the accident. Fell asleep in a metronome factory, when I awoke I completely lost my sense of rhythm. I've been hanging out here ever since.",
        "Guys come and look at this! This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like.",
        "Remind me, why did we put spikes on Buford's chariot again? And a bowling ball catapult? I mean, what were we thinking? Why'd we give them all the cool stuff? What do we have? Cup holders?! Sweet! Now we're cooking.",
        "Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable.",
        "Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying \"spec\" so many times. Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. Perry the Platypus?! I want to say I knew it was you, but I can't, because I didn't.",
        "You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.",
        "Ooh, extra points for recycling. The girls' score is now the square root of pi while the boys still have a crudely-drawn picture of a duck. Clearly it's still anyone's game.",
        "Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is on the move. We tracked him to these coordinates when we suddenly lost his signal. We have two scenarios to explain his disappearance. First, that magical elves have caused Dr. Doofenshmirtz to vanish to the land of angry corn people. The second is that he may be on this secret hideout-shaped island with the initial \"D\" carved into it, that satellites found at the exact... spot... where... he... vanished... uh. You know what, uh, forget the magical elves thing, way off base with that. Anyway, on your way, Agent P.",
        "So what you're saying is if I let you go, you'll tell me where my keys are? Oh, for Pete's sake, why didn't you say that like an hour ago? Oh, look, they were under your cute little platypus foot the whole time.",
        "I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you in case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hopin' that I can borrow a peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important.",
        "I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'd be called Multi-Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt, and use lots of crazy gadgets! He'd be called... um, Ferb Guy!",
        "Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and more important things to worry about. Every single day it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing...",
        "Oh! Agent P! It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases: chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda, and lederhosen. You know, those leather windpipe shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? Man, he is one sick puppy.",

Oh, I'll be in the other room. Oh, I mean for crying out loud- What, you're done already? But, you've only been here for like, 15 seconds. And I've been talking for like, half of that. What kind of a plumber are you? A platypus plumber? Perry the platypus plumber? Perry the Platypus!",
        "We belong together and you know that I'm right. Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind? Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die. How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye? When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight. Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry. Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead. Spinnin' around and around. Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go. It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you.",
        "Cry, little baby bunny! Cry, cry... Aw, you don't know when to quit, do you? I want you to remember this moment, the next time you think you'll ever be anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny!",
        "Felony tax evasion. Yeah... $200 a day, 365 days a year since you were 12. So that's two decades, so times 20, which is $1,460,000, I think. I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying. Anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here... zero! Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time.",
        "Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter, or the only place you'll be selling pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria. It's called a hustle, sweetheart.",
        "I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug, made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Grandmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... What are you, a performer? What's with the costume?",
        "No, I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car! So intimidate me all you want, I'm gonna find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do.",
        "The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met! So l-let me ask you a question: are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? Think I might go savage? You think that I might try to... eat you?! I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh? Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.",
        "Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry! Come on! Thank you, I love you, bye!",
        "Wait, listen! I... I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you. And after we're done... you can hate me. And that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and you- and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along. I really am just a dumb bunny.",
        "Oh, when you walk by every night, talking sweet and looking fine, I get kind of hectic inside. Baby, I'm so into you. Darling, if you only knew, all the things that float through my mind. But, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby. When I close my eyes, you come and take me on, and on, and on. It's so deep in my daydreams, but it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby.",

Something happened to... Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles. And I don't want that to happen to us, okay? Look, I know I don't always do what you need me to do, or say what you need me to say, but I see this spark in you. It's amazing. It's why I push you.

'Cause I have to know your name and leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday. If you want, you can give me yours too and if you don't, I ain't mad at you. We can still be cool. I'm not trying to pressure you, just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend. I just wanna know your name and maybe we can hook up, hang out, just chill.",

If it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by and you can just chill with us, or you can just chill with me. As long as you're comfortable and you feel secure when you're with me.",

It seems as if every time I find the right girl she turns out to be the very wrong girl. Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop? I want somebody to love me for me, not because I'm MC Heavy D. I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock.",

        "It's undeniable that we should be together. It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never. The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel. Then let me show you now that I'm for real. If all things in time, time will reveal. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done, then I start back at one.",

That goes well with referential transparency and it allows you to think of programs as a series of transformations on data.",
        "Haskell is statically typed. When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time. If you try to add together a number and a string, the compiler will whine at you.",

        "Oh thank god. You saved my bacon, pal. Where are we going? Is this a jailbreak? Can't see a thing.",
        "For god's sake, you're BOXES with LEGS! It's literally your only purpose! Walking onto buttons! How can you not do the one thing you were designed for?",
        "You should now feel mentally reinvigorated. If you suspect staring at art has not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this classical music.",
        "Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage.",
        "Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of the room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.",
        "Just a heads-up: that coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronal activity in your brain. There's a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe. Anyway, don't stress yourself thinking about it. I'm serious. Visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction.",
        "I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons! We are going to march right back upstairs and MAKE him put me back in my body!",
        "Did you guess sharks? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is nobody. Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.",
        "Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.",
        "Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room. And I'll tell you about that time I saw a deer again.",
        "Now, if you're part of Control Group Kepler-Seven, we implanted a tiny microchip about the size of a postcard into your skull. Most likely you've forgotten it's even there, but if it starts vibrating and beeping during this next test, let us know, because that means it's about to hit five hundred degrees, so we're gonna need to go ahead and get that out of you pretty fast.",
        "You're not part of the control group, by the way. You get the gel. Last poor son of a gun got blue paint. Hahaha. All joking aside, that did happen - broke every bone in his legs. Tragic. But informative. Or so I'm told.",
        "To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours, and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply. So you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know.",
        "If you are a non-employee who has discovered this facility amid the ruins of civilization, welcome! And remember: testing is the future, and the future starts with you.",
        "Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive club.",
        "The lab boys just informed me that I should not have mentioned the control group. They're telling me I oughta stop making these pre-recorded messages. That gave me an idea: make more pre-recorded messages. I pay the bills here, I can talk about the control group all damn day.",
        "If you've cut yourself at all in the course of these tests, you might have noticed that your blood is pure gasoline. That's normal. We've been shooting you with an invisible laser that's supposed to turn blood into gasoline, so all that means is, it's working.",
        "Great work! Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.",
        "Some emergency testing may require prolonged interaction with lethal military androids. Rest assured that all lethal military androids have been taught to read, and provided with one copy of the Laws of Robotics.",
        "Now, maybe you don't have any tumors. Well, don't worry. If you sat on a folding chair in the lobby and weren't wearing lead underpants, we took care of that too.",
        "This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative: they could not. Good luck!",
        "Oh, in case you got covered in that repulsion gel, here's some advice the lab boys gave me: DO NOT get covered in the repulsion gel.",
        "These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.",
        "Well, no matter. Because I'm still holding all the cards. And guess what: they're all full houses! I've never actually played cards. Meaning to learn.",
        "If you're allergic to peanuts, you might want to tell somebody now, because this next test may turn your blood into peanut water for a few minutes. On the bright side, if we can make this happen, they're gonna have to invent a new type of Nobel Prize to give us, so hang in there.",
        "They told me if I ever turned this flashlight on, I would DIE. They told me that about EVERYTHING. I don't know why they even bothered to give me this stuff if they didn't want me using it. It's pointless.",
        "You know what I have too many of around here? Monitors. I was just thinking earlier today I wish I had fewer monitors that were working. So you're actually helping me by smashing them.",
        "Just thinking back to the old days when we were friends. Good old friends. Not enemies. And I'd say something like \"come back\", and you'd be like \"no problem!\" And you'd come back. What happened to those days?",
        "Don't touch anything else. Don't even look at anything else, just - well obviously you've got to look at everything else to find \"escape pod\", but as soon as you've looked at something and it doesn't say \"escape pod\", look at something else, look at the next thing. Alright?",
        "Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.",
        "Right. Now, you might be asking yourself, \"Cave, just how difficult are these tests? What was in that phone book of a contract I signed? Am I in danger?\"",
        "You could walk out of here with a hundred and twenty weighing down your bindle if you let us take you apart, put some science stuff in you, then put you back together good as new.",
        "Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science.",
        "Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.",
        "By completing all test courses, you have achieved Level C security clearance. You may now access all testing courses and three of Aperture Science's 176 restrooms.",
        "You came back! Didn't actually plan... for that. Can't actually reset the death trap. So. Ah. Could you jump into that pit there? Would you just jump into that pit for me?",
        "Before re-entering a relaxation vault at the conclusion of testing, please take a moment to write down the results of your test. An Aperture Science Reintegration Associate will revive you for an interview when society has been rebuilt.",
        "It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.",
        "Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.",
        "\"Here I am and here I remain!\", he barked. There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths - stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. \"My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: 'Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!'\"",
        "History is a constant race between invention and catastrophe. Education helps but it's never enough. You also must run.",
        "I course backward down the flight of ancestors, hunting along the tributaries, darting into nooks and crannies. You would not recognize many of their names. Who has ever heard of Norma Cenva? I have lived her!",
        "Of course. Why else would one keep one's ancestors around? You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design along with five children. He thought his ego would take no less. In the end, the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image, that was what destroyed him.",
        "An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory, this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal.",
        "Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land. A place where souls may mend your ailing mind. You will lose everything, once branded. The symbol of the curse. An augur of darkness. Your past, your future, your very light. None will have meaning and you won't even care. By then you'll be something other than human. A thing that feeds on souls. A hollow.",
        "Come in search of treats have you? I chanced upon a unique little fungus growing right above us. I've found it only in this station and the taste is just divine.",
        "This place must once have been quite the hub, built at the border between two lands, that misty drop to one side and those bulbous growths another. Neither place seems particularly welcoming so while my little treats last, I think I'll stay right here.",
        "Yes! It is I who is onto you, Old Carl. No one is smarter than the Computer Master! I'm always watching, and I'm always thinking. My brain is much larger than Cheryl's brain. She was a fool for letting me go. But now, I will have my ultimate revenge!",
        "If you expose a given fact and then you prove not to know absolutely nothing about a second element, that makes the first fact real, as it grants totality a more extensive existence.",
        "You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don't you let 'em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change.",

        "Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war. Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They're two sides of the same coin. To protect something, another must be sacrificed.",
        "In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.",
        "Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don't you see? It's an empty existence, to go on living, alone and unloved, when defeat's already cost you your dream!",

        "There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.",
        "The amenities of life have been chasing my soul. And my mind is transcendental, and I'm losing all control. And I'm sinking in the quagmire of illusions and Thoreau. I cry out \"My name is T-Bone\" as a hound-dog digs a hole. You ask so many questions, what answers should I choose? Is this Plato's heebie-jeebies or just existential blues?",

Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on you, is now the one unmasking you. Animated scenes unwind. Dormant figures come to life. Entangled in your own web, a twisted tunnel overhead. A glimpse of light, a drop of dew. You slide into the swimming pool.",

Under the moon I hold, a wake for a promise torn. Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me. Once again my shadow will enter your life. Time to walk with me the last mile! I read a book about a man, a love, a woman, how they died. How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry. I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak. I spent a year in love before I realized it's me!",

Settling the score, we pass the twilight.",
        "Strawberry blonde, your stranglehold on my heart is bound to end. I suppose, life sometimes, it doesn't go the way it was meant. Though you never were a believer, I assure you - I won't die before you. You read the book now, the part: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Short is the fight of this little starling.

Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string to the final hour. Lords of technology that fell into the void. Oh shall it be as it was before. Tragedy on every shore. Is this the end of all we know. Innocence lost so long ago. Woven in dreams, the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny. Decades of greed, plague, famine and war, we can't go on like this anymore. Living like fools, chaos will rule this eternal paradise.",

Tonight darkness will shadow the light. Symmetry divine, there's no force greater dividing the Fathers of Time. Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland. My Serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines. In the night, my army's rage and fury burning my shadow into the land, vengeance by my hand.",

        "Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas. Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees. Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy. Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams. A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky. The stairs of doom towards the ivory tower. A vengeful death that waits for all this time. The judgement has passed, we all now die. A mess of torment for a thousand souls. The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls. The years of torture that have been foretold. A lifetime of fear, they now behold.",
        "Lost in a dream, finally it seems, emptiness and everlasting madness. See the sadness grow, watching as we know, long before our journey for the world. Call for us, the power in all of us. So far beyond the blackened sky tonight. Glorious, forever more in us, we are victorious, and so alive. We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow, our journey on towards a brighter day. Silent tears we left behind, still so far away, across the endless sands through the fields of our despair. Free for all eternity, we stand. Rise above the universe tonight, Starchaser.",
        "Hiding in the fog where darkness meets the moonlight I will sing a melody till the morning comes. Living for you only, take my hand and show me. There will be much sorrow when the morning comes. Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me; find the forces of my soul. No one can understand me, am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone? Tragic painting on the walls. In this castle where affliction reigns so many died in vain, hear their distant cries. Never again!",
        "I will tell you the story of the surprise on that day. I will tell why I am doing so. I did not expect a thing and it's a wonderful thing for my way of life. He said \"Do you wanna touch a star? Do you wanna shine more than ever?\", I said \"I wanna do so by all meanings\". I thought such a chance was rare. I got excited very much. At that time I didn't hesitate to make up my mind. Now I feel the change slowly but surely. Oh can I catch the star like everyone else? I know I should 'cause I wanna get it, ready, fly high!",
        "When the night meets the day, I'll be watchin' the red sky. Hear the whisper of wind, take a power that never end. History tells a lie: we don't believe in the Darkest Age. Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.",
        "No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.",
        "Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.",
        "Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?",
        "And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies.",
        "Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All enemies are comrades.",
        "Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.",
        "Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream.",
        "Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken well and spread my tidings of the golden future time.",
        "They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it.",
        "These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism.",
        "The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: \"Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?\"",
        "In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.",
        "A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.",
        "For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. The first act was to gallop in a body right around the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones' hated reign.",
        "Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.",
        "A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.",
        "They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to seven commandments. These seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.",
        "So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.",
        "In the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was not wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.",
        "With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were.",
        "On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail.",
        "The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.",
        "After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: \"Four legs good, two legs bad\".",
        "We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.",
        "These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.",
        "Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the Rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it.",
        "Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.",
        "All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.",
        "The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder.",
        "There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road.",
        "All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. The boy did not stir.",
        "There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung.",
        "He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.",
        "On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water.",
        "A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.",
        "In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields.",
        "It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.",
        "But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.",
        "In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm.",
        "This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer and an electric milking machine.",
        "Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on - that is, badly.",
        "The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.",
        "He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again.",
        "The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing \"Beasts of England\" and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.",
        "Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility.",
        "A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.",
        "The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.",
        "All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle thieving human beings.",
        "But the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs.",
        "And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings.",
        "From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.",
        "The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible.",
        "The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering, indeed they hated it more than ever.",
        "They would meet in the public houses to prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.",
        "With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out. \"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets'\", she announced finally.",
        "Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.",
        "And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.",
        "Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around.",
        "We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades!",
        "For a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before.",
        "Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.",
        "Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out.",
        "Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stored the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he tramped the seed-beds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.",
        "Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance.",
        "The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers.",
        "But we were all wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered.",
        "Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.",
        "The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded - I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.",
        "\"Ah, that is different!\" said Boxer. \"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.\"",
        "\"That is the true spirit, comrade!\" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes.",
        "He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: 'I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!'",
        "Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances.",
        "They did not know which was more shocking - the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed.",
        "I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings.",
        "It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun.",
        "The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they said it three times over - very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.",
        "\"It is no longer needed comrade,\" said Squealer stiffly. \"'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now completed.\"",
        "In \"Beasts of England\" we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer any purpose.",
        "But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.",
        "In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon.",
        "Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.",
        "As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger.",
        "The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn.",
        "Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time.",
        "The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. Banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!",
        "Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the windmill down. 'Impossible!' cried Napoleon.",
        "When they got up again a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased to exist!",
        "A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail.",
        "Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill once stood.",
        "What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. And now - thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon - we have won every inch of it back again!",
        "They had thought that the Fifth Commandment was 'No animal shall drink alcohol', but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: 'No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.'",
        "A too-rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism.",
        "There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage.",
        "About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sunday.",
        "The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.",
        "In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.",
        "\"Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bonemeal. Kennels Supplied.\" Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!",
        "The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice.",
        "Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded.",
        "That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.",
        "Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes.",
        "They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood much of it.",
        "But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.",
        "After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.",
        "The animals were weeding the turnip field. They worked diligently, hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.",
        "And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality?",
        "He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours.",
        "After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get out: 'If you have your lower animals to contend with,' he said, 'we have our lower classes!' This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working-hours and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.",
        "Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours.",
        "There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden.",
        "I will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!",
        "There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.",
        "Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which.",
        "Es gibt sechs Wochen voller Sommerferientage, bis die Schule beginnt und es ernst wird. Und so stellt sich wie jedes Jahr wieder die Frage: Was tun, dass es ein toller Spa\u00df wird?

        "But instead, our standard is this layout called \"qwerty\". You might guess, \"oh, it's probably because layout designers found this layout was the fastest.\" It must take the most common letters and put them in the most easily accessible locations. That, is not true.",
        "The QWERTY layout was created around the 1870s when typing was done on typewriters: that old, mechanical device that had a keyboard and directly printed letters onto a piece of paper using ink. The exact reasons for this design are still unclear - many people say the letters are laid out to make the most common keys harder to reach, therefore reducing the risk of jams - others believe the layout was a result of advice given by morse code telegraph operators. Regardless, the QWERTY layout was designed to solve a problem that no longer exists - so the question remains: why do we still use it?",
        "So the question remains: why do we still use QWERTY? There is no reason, aside from the fact that it came first. It was already the standard when computer keyboards came into prominence, and now that it's so widespread, it would be an extremely difficult task to alter that standard.",
        "There are a surprising amount of alternate layouts, and my only problem with Colemak was an over-reliance on the middle two columns. There are a number of factors that keyboard layouts can optimize for, but I was looking for maximum home row usage with minimal middle column usage.",
        "There are a few videos and articles on the internet of people learning these alternate layouts - they're fine, my only problem with them is the fact that they never really get to a words per minute that I would consider as mastery - and sometimes, they don't even talk about their peak speed at all.",
        "It's been a while since I tried to learn Colemak. I underestimated how difficult it actually is to unlearn your muscle memory. When you are quick with typing, you don't think about what your fingers are doing, or where any of the letters are - it's all done by feel. I can type with my eyes closed because I've practiced enough to not need any visual reference while typing.",
        "Overwriting the habits and techniques that I use to type each word is actually pretty mentally taxing: suddenly, you have to think about every single key that you press and resist your muscle memory's inclination to hit a different key.",
        "There are two things that you have to achieve before you can start getting to respectable speeds. First, know the locations of the keys by memory. I'm talking about not looking at your keyboard or any other reference image while you're typing. You should be able to remember the general location of every key after a moment of thought. Second, know the locations of the keys without having to think about it. This means committing the locations of the keys to muscle memory. You shouldn't have to actively think about where any of the letters are - your fingers should know where to go automatically.",
        "I was getting ten words per minute faster every single day, up until the fifty to sixty threshold. And I still improved, but it started to slow down to about five words per minute a day. As for QWERTY, I could still switch instantly. It didn't even take a second to adjust.",
        "I continued getting better every day - after two weeks, I got my first 100 words per minute score. After a month, my first average of a hundred. I was feeling good: my improvement was consistent, and at this rate, I'd be catching up to my QWERTY speed soon. But improving at typing is not a linear process: even though I was getting better every day, after you reach a certain skill level, your improvement rate starts to slow down, just like any other skill. And that reality started to hit me.",
        "Breaking plateaus in anything is a difficult task. Sometimes, a new practice method can help you push through it, and other times, it's just more and more focused practice. My problem was that I was obsessed with speed, but sometimes you gotta take it slow, and refine each and every motion that you're making. That's what let me break through: I had to slow down to go faster.",
        "While this is a video about typing, continuing to get better at anything requires this sort of self-analysis. Of course, there's an element of endless practice, but you have know what and how to practice too.",
        "Whether you play shooters or rhythm games, or it's another skill like an instrument or sport, it is so important that you analyze your own weaknesses and mistakes and make the most of the time you spend practicing. Twenty minutes of focused practice is so much more productive than an hour of aimless practice.",
        "If you pick up an alternate layout, you will probably see improvement in your overall words per minute, mostly because it'll force you to re-learn how to type, and more importantly, how to touch type.",
        "If you're just looking for raw speed, then do all the practice that you can and analyze yourself for areas of improvement. But if you like the idea of rewiring your brain and starting from scratch, then maybe you can find yourself an alternate layout and get good with that.",

        "Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.",
        "...eventually a deep silence falls and we begin to notice the smallest sounds, the radiator humming in the corner of the room, the nasal breathing of one of the fat students. Some of us are agitated. When is he going to say something? We squirm, check our watches. A few students look out the window, trying to be above it all. This goes on a good fifteen minutes, before Morrie finally breaks in with a whisper. \"What's happening here?\" he asks.",
        "This, for Morrie, was a blessing. He hated the place. He made another vow that he kept to the end of his life: he would never do any work that exploited someone else, and he would never allow himself to make money off the sweat of others.",
        "This is part of what a family is about, not just love, but letting others know there's someone who is watching out for them. It's what I missed so much when my mother died - what I call your 'spiritual security' - knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame.",
        "We laughed, and Morrie laughed, too, as hard as he could, with his limited breathing. It was the first time in weeks that I could recall him telling a story like this. How strange, I thought, that he nearly fainted once from watching someone else's illness, and now he was so able to endure his own.",
        "You realize that, especially when you're in a time like I am, when you're not doing so well. Friends are great, but friends are not going to be here on a night when you're coughing and can't sleep and someone has to sit up all night with you, comfort you and try to be helpful.",
        "The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready... start!",
        "We never know how high we are till we are called to rise; and then, if we are true to plan, our statures touch the skies - the Heroism we recite would be a daily thing, did not ourselves the Cubits warp for fear to be a king.",

        "The boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was dark gray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into the quick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face.",

        "She loved everything that grew in God's earth, even the weeds. With one exception. If she found a blade of nutgrass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it'd kill us all if we didn't stand out of the way.",
        "His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and sat on his cot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I heard his cot trembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.",
        "I told you that if you hadn't lost your head I'd have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her - I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.",
        "This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides and said, \"Stand still!\" Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling. Who started this? said Uncle Jack.",
        "Somehow everything was different, like a new person had emerged from me; I could see myself in a perspective that I've never seen before: no ambitions, no worries. For the first time I felt like I knew where I belonged and nothing could stop me from being there. Nothing and yet everything felt real. The world was underneath me, around me, above me; I could see everything and everything could see me. I found... Peace.",
        "This time we aren't fighting the Yankees, we're fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they're still our friends and this is still our home.",
        "Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement, Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way. \"How'd you get here?\" asked Jem.",
        "There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one - \"That's a lie. Aunty said God drops 'em down the chimney. At least that's what I think she said.\" For once, Aunty's diction had not been too clear.",
        "We do not propose to say that there shall be no rich men. We do not ask to divide the wealth. We only propose that, when one man gets more than he and his children and his children's children can spend or use in their lifetimes, that then we shall say that such person has his share. That means a few million dollars is the limit to what any one man can own.",
        "Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me - and I welcome their hatred.",
        "One night, the girl dreamed about her own mother. \"Where are you going?\" she asked her mother's retreating back. Without turning, her mother replied, \"Don't fret, dearest. I'm not going anywhere. I'm always watching over you, like the sun in the day and the moon in the night.\" A wave of sadness washed over the girl. \"What about when it rains, and I can't see the sun or the moon?\" Her mother thought for a moment before responding. \"I will turn into a star in the clouds and wait for your tears to dry.\"",
        "Suddenly, more Lumas began to pop out from the apricot planet. They were different colors, but they all shouted the same thing. \"My mama!\" \"My mama!\" The sight of all the shouting Lumas only made the girl laugh harder. \"What am I going to do with all these children?\" The Lumas just stared blankly as she doubled over laughing. \"I guess we'll have to name each and every one of you.\"",
        "She remembered rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she followed her father up that hill to look at the stars... she remembered having picnics with her mother on that hill on bright and windy days... and... \"I want to go home! I want to go home right now!\" The girl burst into tears, and the Lumas didn't know what to do. The girl was shouting now, her face wet with tears. \"But I know she's not there! I knew all along that she wasn't out there in the sky! Because... because... she's sleeping under the tree on the hill!\" The girl's cries echoed through the stars, and a hush fell over the area.",
        "With that, Luma, trailing bands of white, soared high into the sky and just as quickly started to plummet back down. KABOOM! KABLAM! The ground shook, and a bright light poured out of the crater that the Luma had created.",
        "That night, when the girl lay down to sleep, a soft light enveloped her and reminded her of the blue planet she once called home. \"But it would be nice to return home once every one hundred years to nap in my favorite sleeping nook.\" The comet carrying the Lumas and the girl continues on its journey to this very day. With more \"family members\" in tow than can be counted, it's said that the comet visits the girl's home planet once every hundred years, its proud white tail glittering in the sky.",
        "Days passed with no sight of the comet, or even a single planet. Instead, asteroids extended for as far as the eye could see. \"If I had known it was going to take this long, I would have packed more jam,\" said the little girl, above the rumble of her belly.",
        "The pair traveled through the starry skies, and though they encountered many other comets, not one of them held Luma's mother. Luma was despondent. \"Now, now, Luma. The rain clouds won't go away if you keep crying,\" the girl said, giving Luma a squeeze. \"I'll give you a present if you stop.\" The girl closed her eyes and said gently, \"I'll take care of you.\" With these words, she felt a small spark in her heart.",
        "The bands of light twisted together to form a comet tail. And then Luma emerged, reborn as a comet. The girl could scarcely believe her eyes. \"But... how?\" she kept asking. \"Our destiny as Lumas is to transform into different things,\" said a red Luma who had suddenly appeared. \"Stars, comets, planets... We can become all of these things!\" \"When I grow up, I want to become a star that makes someone special smile,\" said a green Luma. A blue Luma chimed in, \"That Luma turned into a real cutie of a comet, didn't he!\"",
        "Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl. One day, this girl spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child. \"What's your name? Are you lost?\" the girl asked the star child. \"I'm Luma, and I'm waiting for Mama. She's coming for me on a comet!\" said the star child, who had been waiting day and night. \"Don't worry, I'll wait with you,\" the little girl promised Luma.",
        "I waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win, but he's the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And I thought to myself, well, we're taking a step - it's just a baby-step, but it's a step.",
        "This lake of fire burns my skin. How could love wear so thin? I'm sinking in the hollow ground; nothing can stop me wanting you somehow. I won't let it die; I can feel you when you're not around. When the night gets cold, I won't be alone. We won't be alone.",
        "I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes, then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days before the politics that we call the rap game, and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape. So can I get a wish to end the politics, and get back to the music that started this...? So here I stand, and then again I say - I'm hoping we can make some wishes out of airplanes.",
        "I watched her for a moment and she said he was sure he couldn't pay more than seventeen fifty for that china. She reached into the red velvet case, took out a dinner plate and hurled it at the floor right in front of his feet... Mama took out another dinner plate and hurled it at the floor, then another and another, never moving, never opening her mouth, just quivering and glaring at the retreating dealer, with tears streaming down her cheeks... When he was gone she stood there smashing cups and bowls and platters until the whole set lay in scattered blue and white fragments across the wooden floor.",
        "Among the Japanese, of course, rice is never eaten with sweet foods, only with salty or savory foods. Few of us could eat such a mixture. But at this point no one dared protest.

        "I think he knows I'm alive, having come down the tree steps of the back porch and given me a good once over. All afternoon he's been moving back and forth, gathering odd bits of walnut shells and twigs, while all about him the great fields tumble to the blades of the thresher. He's lucky to be where he is, wild with all that happens. He's lucky he's not one of the shadows living in the blond heart of the wheat. The autumn when trees bolt, dark with the fires of starlight, he'll curl among their roots, wanting nothing but the slow burn of matter on which he fastens like a small, brown flame.",

        "We are taught not to gamble. Perhaps it is thought we have lost enough already: legs, vision, speech, the typical use of our bodies. Others' fears would teach us to cringe at any thought of any risk. Disability and risk don't mix. Risk is something we are supposed to be protected from - by agencies, by professionals - by parents, by doctors - by invisibility, by shame - by confinement if necessary. We must be kept safe: This is one of the lies which fills the beds of the so-called \"homes.\" So we embrace the risks to fight the lies.",

        "The hard part is selecting which ideas to act on. Brainstorm selection may be straight forward for some brainstorms, but selecting design solutions may take more deliberation.

Identifying a variable not only saves time and money, it gives you the opportunity to test multiple prototypes, each varying in one property. This encourages the user to make nuanced comparisons between prototypes and choose one option over another.",

        "During the design process, it can be unclear how to proceed forward, particularly when team members have mixed opinions. The best way to resolve team conflicts about design elements is to prototype and evaluate them with users. If a prototype is received well, it's a good sign it's worth pursuing further.",

They expect nothing else. But to do that, you must believe in what you're fighting for. If you are not willing to die, you won't fight well. And if you don't fight well you will probably be killed stupidly, for the wrong reason, and unheroically.",

He played the three-string shamisen, which Kiyo and I called his \"pinko-pinko.\" We would laugh together when we heard him plucking it and whining out Japanese melodies. We would hold our ears and giggle. It was always a great joke between us, except for those rare times when Papa began to weep at the lyrics. Then we would just stare quietly - as I did that night - from some hidden corner of the room. This was always mysterious and incomprehensible.",

        "I used to rule the world: seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning, I sleep alone - sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice - feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, \"Now the old King is dead, long live the King.\" One minute I held the key; next the walls were closed on me - and I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.",
        "It was a wicked and wild wind: blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sounds of drums - people couldn't believe what I'd become: just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh, who would ever want to be King! I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing; Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword, my shield - my missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word - and that was when I ruled the world.",

        "The psychology department actually studies the limits of almost all psychology. And it's only when you go to graduate school that you can do some real research. In graduate school, after deciding on a specific major and an academic adviser and applying, you have to pass an interview and written evaluation of your research plans.",
        "It happened during the procession at a parish church in Ontario, Canada. As the choir moved in perfect unison to the hymn, the last young lady slipped her stiletto heel into the grating over a hot air duct in the center of the aisle. The first man following her noticed the situation, and without skipping a beat, reached down and swooped up the shoe. The entire grating came with it. Startled, but still singing, the man marched on, carrying in his hand the shoe with the grating attached. There was never a break in the procession and right in time to the beat, the next man fell into the open duct.",
        "The little organ wheezed and gasped for breath, the young organist pumping the pedals furiously trying to keep the beat and the hymn alive.",
        "This church had no walls, no ceiling, no altar, no stained glass windows. Granite outcroppings and boulders served as walls; tall pines were the support beams. The ceiling was the deep blue sky that canopied the highest ridge, the tallest tree. Instead of richly colored stained glass windows, we looked out on pine-covered ridges mounting one after another, each one higher, as if to touch the still hidden snowcaps we knew to be just beyond our line of vision.",
        "To this day, I cannot sing those old familiar hymns without bringing all my senses into play. Somewhere I hear the wheezing, gasping sounds of that decrepit organ. I conjure up the fragrance of Ponderosa pine. I feel the mountain wind stirring my hair. And in my mind's eye I see the faces of the friends of my youth. The memories from a mere 30 Sundays, spread over six summers out of a lifetime, reach across the years and are as vivid to me now as the last time I worshiped on that hill far away.",
        "But I wish that just once more I could sit in a straight-backed wicker chair on that platform on the side of a hill in Colorado. I wish that just once more I could look up at the ridges, breathe in the fragrance of the pines, hear the gasping notes from that old pump organ and see the faces of the friends of my youth. I wish just once more, I could sing - on that hill far away.",

But know this, you are my greatest disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things! A time to live and a time to die, a time to build... and a time to destroy!",

        "Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile. With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal, only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.",

        "Political danger. The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses. But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis we could be stronger than ever.",
        "For 80 years Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen. Eighty years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? In your eyes, I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonners before. I have. They are not human. They're brutal! You have to be ready.",

        "The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.",
        "Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.",
        "Mr. Peters straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming of a man of forty-five.",

        "According to one theory, the wisdom of the crowd still holds - measuring the aggregate of people's opinions produces a stable, reliable value. Skeptics, however, argue that people's opinions are easily swayed by those of others.

Why did you go, though we were running freely through open meadows of fire and waterfalls? I thought we'd always last in this story we brought into being. Now all I am is leaving me so slowly; I'll never understand why I'm lonely: we once had it all. It only comes in my mind in shattered little frames all of the times my heart hears your name: I loved you - I loved you in my universe. How can it end? Refrain; I can't amend this pain...",

        "Meanwhile, improving by one percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable - but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.",
        "If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.",

        "In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.",
        "You think, \"I've been running every day for a month, so why can't I see any change in my body?\" Once this kind of thinking takes over, it's easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau.",

        "The flame flew forward and illuminated the interior. The passageway seemed to go on forever. Soon enough, the flame lost its forward momentum, fell to the ground and smouldered for a bit before flickering out of existence.",
        "Now normally, we're supposed to relay this information back to the Association and wait for their decision first, but... But, if we do that, we might end up handing over the task of killing the boss to other Hunters, and our takings for today's raid would decrease by a lot.",

I have lost the minutes and hours. And every so often I will see it again: Light - true light - in the distance. Perhaps it has been guiding me. I wouldn't admit this, to anyone. It's like a loss: relinquishing myself to what I've long criticized. However, I feel it for certain: that light is now beckoning me. That light of the old world is shining, and wants me. And in that light, I find deliverance...",

I could do the job better than that god. But, I will need hands again for it first. I shouldn't simply think or talk that I might be better. I'll do it. I will. But really... I am not swelling with pride as I escape here. Instead, take this as revenge. I'll change the world, or craft a better one. You've left this one broken so badly. Isn't anything possible? I think so. No... I know it.",

Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.",
        "They stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of Earth, much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of Mars; it was a problem reversed. But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other's faces. At nine o'clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn. The people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out. They waited.",
        "I hate being clever, thought the captain, when you don't really feel clever and don't want to be clever. To sneak around and make plans and feel big about making them. I hate this feeling of thinking I'm doing right when I'm not really certain I am.",
        "Who are we, anyway? The majority? Is that the answer? The majority is always holy, is it now? Always, always; just never wrong for one little insignificant tiny moment, is it? Never ever wrong in ten million years? He thought: What is this majority and who are in it? And what do they think and how did they get that way and will they ever change and how the devil did I get caught in this rotten majority?",
        "Will I be clean after this? he thought. Is it right that it's me who does it? Yes, it is. I know what I'm doing for what reason and it's right, because I think I'm the right person. I hope and pray I can live up to this.",
        "\"Come on,\" he said. \"We've got to get the place fixed! All the hot dogs boiling, the buns warm, the chili cooking, the onions peeled and diced, the relish laid out, the napkins in the dips, the place spotless! Hey!\" He did a little wild dance, kicking his heels. \"Oh boy, I'm happy; yes sir, I'm happy,\" he sang off key. \"This is my lucky day!\"",
        "\"Send me your hungry, old Earth. Here's Sam Parkhill, his hot dogs all boiled, his chili cooking, everything neat as a pin. Come on, you Earth, send me your rocket!\" \"It sure makes you humble,\" he said among the cooking odors of wieners, warm buns, rich butter. \"Step up,\" he invited the various stars in the sky. \"Who'll be the first to buy?\"",
        "Earth changed in the black sky. It caught fire. Part of it seemed to come apart in a million pieces, as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle had exploded. It had burned with an unholy dripping glare for a minute, three times normal size, then dwindled.",
        "Night after night for every year and every year, for no reason at all, the woman comes out and looks at the sky, her hands up, for a long moment, looking at the green burning of Earth, not knowing why she looks, and then she goes back and throws a stick on the fire, and the wind comes up and the dead sea goes on being dead.",
        "A silver ring fish floated by them, undulating, and closing like an iris, instantly, around food particles, to assimilate them. Dad looked at it. His voice was deep and quiet. \"Just like war. War swims along, sees food, contracts. A moment later - Earth is gone.\"",
        "There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, and swallows with their shimmering sound; And frogs in the pools singing at night, and wild plum trees in tremulous white; Robins will wear their feathery fire, whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done. Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly; And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone.",
        "Dimitri said something in Russian to them. They said something back. He said some other thing and pointed to me. They smiled and made happy Russian sounds.",
        "Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow, wad, flush.",
        "The black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.",
        "As the harbor shrinks, growing fainter in the distance, severing you forever from this strange, newly formed nation called the United States, you haven't the slightest idea after years of war which of these names fits, or what the future holds, though on one matter you are clear: From the start, you were fighting for no one but yourself.",
        "I need you more than you know, more than you'd believe. You're the only thing that really makes me want to live. There are times when I feel like I have no will to fight. You always come and chase the demons from my mind. You're beautiful inside and out, and I wish to thank you, for you're the one who made me want to stay.",
        "The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.",
        "I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.",
        "And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.",
        "He said to his friend, \"If the British march by land or sea from the town to-night, hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the North Church tower as a signal light, - one, if by land, and two, if by sea; and I on the opposite shore will be, ready to ride and spread the alarm through every Middlesex village and farm, for the country folk to be up and to arm.\"",
        "[In outer space,] you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.",
        "Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see. It was unbelieveable. Unbelieveable. I mean, the little things, the weightlessness. But to see the blue color go whip by, and now you're staring into blackness. That's the thing... And there's something you shoot through, and all of a sudden, as though you whip a sheet off you when you're asleep, and you're looking into blackness, into black ugliness. And you look down. There's the blue down there and black up there. And there is mother Earth and comfort. And up there... is that death? I don't know.",
        "The thing that really surprised me was that it [Earth] projected an air of fragility. And why, I don't know. I don't know to this day. I had a feeling it's tiny, it's shiny, it's beautiful, it's home, and it's fragile.",
        "I want everyone to love me, I want everyone to trust me. Not gonna happen, I think about this every day, and dream about it every night, what am I lacking?",
        "After they came and destroyed the land, there was one spark of hope left for all of mankind.",
        "Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry.",
        "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.",
        "Within the space of a few decades, the way children understand and experience nature has changed radically. The polarity of the relationship has reversed. Today, kids are aware of the global threats to the environment - but their physical contact, their intimacy with nature, is fading. That's exactly the opposite of how it was when I was a child.",
        "The shift in our relationship to the natural world is startling, even in settings that one would assume are devoted to nature. Not that long ago, summer camp was a place where you camped, hiked in the woods, learned about plants and animals, or told firelight stories about ghosts or mountain lions. As likely as not today, \"summer camp\" is a weight-loss camp, or a computer camp.",
        "Our society is teaching young people to avoid direct experience in nature. That lesson is delivered in schools, families, even organizations devoted to the outdoors, and codified into the legal and regulatory structures of many of our communities. Our institutions... unconsciously associate nature with doom - while disassociating the outdoors from joy and solitude.",
        "The postmodern notion that reality is only a construct - that we are what we program - suggests limitless human possibilities; but as the young spend less and less of their lives in natural surroundings, their senses narrow, physiologically and psychologically, and this reduces the richness of human experience.",
        "We were like children lost in our own dream; we never knew love's a garden and hard to grow. We thought the magic would lead us upstream, but we fell. It's not our fault - it's how currents flow. Even though it's hard to know you are leaving this picture, you remain another memory of summer when we loved. Even the winter cold feels warm, shining with light from all I kept inside from you. That is how the heart can live on and on.",
        "What happens to a heart when love ends? Does it fade into a shadow of remorse when it bends? Or can it fly to the sky like a bird - lighter than ever, stronger too? Oh, I think a heart always learns to come through. Where do the teardrops go when they dry? Do they follow all the raindrops and return to the sky? Even a sparrow with broken wings looks to the sun and finds a song; oh, I think the heart always learns to be strong. Where did the sorrow go? Who gave me back the sun, I don't know! Opening my eyes, I see blue skies..."
